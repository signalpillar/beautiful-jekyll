      <description>I decided to move from a single org file to hugo and have &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; design of the blog.
The trick with adding github repo as a submodule (master branch) keeps the repo clean. Hugo website has a great documentation.
 Theme Edited in Emacs + emacs-easy-hugo  </description>

      <description> My practices    document all in one document - one markdown (org) document for everything    don’t worry about the size of it. Extract only the topics that have a critical size. What is critical is for you to determine but mostly you&amp;#39;ll feel it by structure not amount of text. If structure is super extensive that is the time.    the structure develops organically    Suggested software  Typora (no mobile support, no good tables support like OneNote has)    has a great performance    it’s easy to insert media in it    has good support of lists    has outline view    supports mermaid diagrams    Joplin    has end-to-end encyprtion    supports many platforms    Bear (only Apple OS) </description>
