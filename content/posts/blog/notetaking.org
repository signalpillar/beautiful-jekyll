*My practices*

- document all in one document - one markdown (org) document for everything
- don’t worry about the size of it. Extract only the topics that have a critical
  size. What is critical is for you to determine but mostly you'll feel it by
  structure not amount of text. If structure is super extensive that is the
  time.
- the structure develops organically

*Suggested software*

*Typora* (no mobile support, no good tables support like OneNote has)

- has a great performance
- it’s easy to insert media in it
- has good support of lists
- has outline view
- supports mermaid diagrams

*Joplin*
- has end-to-end encyprtion
- supports many platforms

*Bear* (only Apple OS)
