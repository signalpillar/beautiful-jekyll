I like OCaml but the learning curve is too steep for me so I decided to start
with small and develop my toolbox first.

* Given an array of integers, can you find the sum of its elements?

#+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
let () =
  let array_size = read_int() in
  let array = Array.init array_size in
  ...
#+END_SRC
