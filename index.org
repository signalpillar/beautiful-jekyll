**  tox & emacs                                                 :tox:python:

I am havy user of *tox*. Every new project has one and it is not only because I
can keep my dependencies and tools configuration in one place but also because I
have a nice integration with Emacs.

I press *f4* and select the test environment to use.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (global-set-key [f4] 'sp/tox/activate-current-project-tox-env)
#+END_SRC

Powerful combo of tox, projectile, and helm.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun sp/tox/find-tox-dirs-in-project (project-root-dir)

  (defun -find-toxenv-bin-dirs (root)
    (projectile-files-via-ext-command
     root
     (format "find %s -type d -name 'bin' -path '*/.tox/*/bin' -print0" root)))

  (-map (lambda (file) (sp/path/parent-dir (sp/path/parent-dir file)))
        (-find-toxenv-bin-dirs project-root-dir)))

(defun sp/tox/activate-current-project-tox-env ()
  (interactive)

         (venv-dirs (sp/tox/find-tox-dirs-in-project (projectile-project-root)))

** Just another attempt
Another attempt to have a place to write short notes. In org-mode. Without tooling.

1. Update =index.org=
2. Export to HTML file. In spacemacs it is =,meehh=.
3. Push to github.

The theme for HTML page is [[https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes#bigblow][Bigblow]].

SCHEDULED: <2018-11-24 Sat>

*** Load/Dump of structural data

*What do we want to do?*

- Describe hierarchical data using classes with attributes that have type hints.
  It can be =typing.NamedTuple=, =dataclasses.dataclass= or something else that has
  nice way of specifying the attributes and their types.
- Using the library create the instance of the described classes from JSON or
  just a regular mapping (=typing.Mapping=).
- Serialise instance to =dict= or JSON.
- Have a nice error reporting that helps in understanding where the data
  doesn't match some type.

*Why we need this*?

It is an easy way to declare configuration structure in the file, payload or
request params, validate them and serialise back if needed.

*Tools*

[[https://pypi.org/project/pydantic/][pydantic]] another data validation and settings management library that heavily
relies on type hints.

[[https://github.com/ltworf/typedload][typedload]] is an amazing library that helps load/dump dictionary to the data
class or =typing.NamedTuple= with minimal effort. Without any additional
attributes just using pure type annotations it understands how to map the fields.

[[https://pypi.org/project/attrs/][attrs]] + [[https://pypi.org/project/cattrs/][cattrs]] while attrs library is very popular it is a last choice for me. =cattrs=
at the moment I've tried it was the lib that didn't have a nice error type that
I could catch and be sure that is validation error. The library could raise
=ValueError=, for instance, and error wouldn't give me much information about the
place where it failed. Maybe I didn't know how to cook it properly or I don't
have a case for it.
