** Install Manjaro On Oracle Virtualbox
Manjaro is super easy to install in VM, the installer is beautiful and simple.
To bootstrap the OS install VBox guest tools and =chezmoi= to apply my configuration.

*** Video
To get Auto-Resize Guest Display working switch 'VBoxSVGA' adapter from 'VMSVGA'.

I am heavy user of *tox*. Every new project has one and it is not only because I
can keep my dependencies and tools configuration in one place but also because I
have a nice integration with Emacs.

I press *f4* and select the test environment to use.

** Just another attempt

Another attempt to have a place to write short notes. In org-mode. Without tooling.

1. Update =index.org=
2. Export to HTML file. In spacemacs it is =,meehh=.
3. Push to github.

The theme for HTML page is [[https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes#bigblow][Bigblow]].

** Another tool on my tool belt                                     :python:
*** Dependency injection

[[https://pypi.org/project/injector/][injector]] is an underrated project. I can tell that because I haven't see a single
project in Python that uses it (except of one I am working on).
Works with the type hints and encourages good style in code writing:

- no globals
- testable code

I didn't quite determined best practices how to use injector for integration
tests in the application.

[[https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Injector/][flask-injector]] is a small extension to the injector library, that brings some
new dependencies from Flask world and =request= scope.

*** Load/Dump of structural data

*What do we want to do?*

- Describe hierarchical data using classes with attributes that have type hints.
  It can be =typing.NamedTuple=, =dataclasses.dataclass= or something else that has
  nice way of specifying the attributes and their types.
- Using the library create the instance of the described classes from JSON or
  just a regular mapping (=typing.Mapping=).
- Serialise instance to =dict= or JSON.
- Have a nice error reporting that helps in understanding where the data
  doesn't match some type.

*Why we need this*?

It is an easy way to declare configuration structure in the file, payload or
request params, validate them and serialise back if needed.

*Tools*

[[https://pypi.org/project/pydantic/][pydantic]] another data validation and settings management library that heavily
relies on type hints.

[[https://github.com/ltworf/typedload][typedload]] is an amazing library that helps load/dump dictionary to the data
class or =typing.NamedTuple= with minimal effort. Without any additional
attributes just using pure type annotations it understands how to map the fields.

[[https://pypi.org/project/attrs/][attrs]] + [[https://pypi.org/project/cattrs/][cattrs]] while attrs library is very popular it is a last choice for me. =cattrs=
at the moment I've tried it was the lib that didn't have a nice error type that
I could catch and be sure that is validation error. The library could raise
=ValueError=, for instance, and error wouldn't give me much information about the
place where it failed. Maybe I didn't know how to cook it properly or I don't
have a case for it.
** cheatsheet
*** Error: Cask 'java' is unreadable: undefined method `undent' for #<String:0x00007f8fea93cc78>
[[https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/issues/49716#issuecomment-413515303][Source]]
#+begin_example
find "$(brew --prefix)/Caskroom/"*'/.metadata' -type f -name '*.rb' | xargs grep 'EOS.undent' --files-with-matches | xargs sed -i '' 's/EOS.undent/EOS/'
#+end_example
** Note taking

*Quick start*

- document your knowledge
- document all in one document - one markdown (org) document for everything
- don’t worry about the size of it. Extract only the topics that have a critical
  size. What is critical is for you to determine but mostly you'll feel it by
  structure not amount of text. If structure is super extensive that is the
  time.
- the structure develops organically
*** *Suggested software*

*Typora* (no mobile support, no good tables support like OneNote)

- has a great performance
- it’s easy to insert media in it
- has good support of lists
- has outline view
- supports mermaid diagrams

*Joplin*
- has end-to-end encyprtion
- supports many platforms

*Bear* (only Apple OS)
